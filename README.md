## How this model was trained

### Dataset
This model was trained on the ["Hand Keypoint Dataset 26K"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/riondsilva21/hand-keypoint-dataset-26k) made by [Rion Dsilva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rion-dsilva-043464229/)

The hand keypoint dataset is split into two subsets:

1. **Train**: This subset contains 18,776 images from the hand keypoints dataset, annotated for training pose estimation models.
2. **Val**: This subset contains 7992 images that can be used for validation purposes during model training.

### Mosaiced Images

> This image demonstrates a training batch composed of mosaiced dataset images. Mosaicing is a technique used during training that combines multiple images into a single image to increase the variety of objects and scenes within each training batch. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize to different object sizes, aspect ratios, and contexts. - [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/pose/hand-keypoints/#sample-images-and-annotations)
